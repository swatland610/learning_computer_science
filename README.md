# Learning Computer Science
This repo is about me trying to learn some computery stuff - mainly stuff that is in [Structure & Interpretation of Computation Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). 

I am proud of what I have been able to learn over the past 4 years at my work. I do feel that my skills are missing some foundational understandings. So I'd like to shore that up! 

I started back in 2022 reading this book using lisp as the framework for my assignments. Rather, I'll start off with Elixir & maybe translate some of that to Python. 

We'll see!
